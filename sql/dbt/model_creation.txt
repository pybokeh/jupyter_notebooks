# 2 ways to set materialization type (view vs table)
- from dbt_project.yml file
- Embed config in your model .sql file with jinja syntax.  For example:
{{
    config(
        materialized='table' | 'view'
    )
}}

# To choose or select which models to materialize:
dbt run --select <model_name>


# In the models folder, create new text file where the file name will be the table or model name with .sql extension


# Referencing dbt models/tables
select * from {{ ref('dbt_table_name') }}

# To ensure full refresh
dbt run --ful-refresh

# Testing in dbt - 4 assertion types
- unique
- not_null
- accepted_values
- relationships

# To test dbt models
- Create schema.yml file
- Then run: dbt test

# To generate docs (.html) file
dbt docs generate

# To view the docs in browser
dbt docs serve
