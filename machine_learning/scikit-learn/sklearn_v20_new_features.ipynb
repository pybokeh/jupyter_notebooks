    "# Scikit-Learn's new integration with Pandas\n",
    "Scikit-Learn will make one of its biggest upgrades in recent years with its mammoth version 0.20 release. For many data scientists, a typical workflow consists of using Pandas to do exploratory data analysis before moving to scikit-learn for machine learning. This new release will make the process simpler, more feature-rich, robust, and standardized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary and goals of this article\n",
    "This article is aimed at those that use Scikit-Learn as their machine learning library but depend on Pandas as their data exploratory and preparation tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It assumes you have some familiarity with both Scikit-Learn and Pandas\n",
    "* We explore the new ColumnTransformer estimator, which allows us to apply separate transformations to different subsets of your data in parallel before concatenating the results together.\n",
    "* A major pain point for users (and in my opinion the worst part of Scikit-Learn) was preparing a pandas DataFrame with string values in its columns. This process should become much more standardized.\n",
    "* The OneHotEncoder estimator was given a nice upgrade to encode columns with string values. \n",
    "* To help with one hot encoding, we use the new SimpleImputer estimator to fill in missing values with constants\n",
    "* We will build a custom estimator that does all the \"basic\" transformations on a DataFrame instead of relying on the built-in Scikit-Learn tools. This will also transform the data with a couple different features not present within Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "* Finally, we explore binning numeric columns with the new KBinsDiscretizer estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note before we get started\n",
    "This tutorial is provided as a preview of things to come. The final version 0.20 has not been released. It is very likely that this tutorial will be updated at a future date to reflect any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuing…\n",
    "For those that use Pandas as as their exploratory and preparation tool before moving to Scikit-Learn for machine learning, you are likely familiar with the non-standard process of handling columns containing string columns. Scikit-Learn's machine learning models require the input to be a two dimensional data structure of numeric values. No string values are allowed. Scikit-Learn never provided a canonical way to handle columns of strings, a very common occurrence in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lead to numerous tutorials all handling string columns in their own way. Some solutions included turning to Pandas get_dummies function. Some used Scikit-Learn'sLabelBinarizer which does one-hot encoding, but was designed for labels (the target variable) and not for the input. Others created their own custom estimators. Even entire packages such as [sklearn-pandas][1] were built to support this trouble spot. This lack of standardization made for a painful experience for those wanting to build machine learning models with string columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there was poor support for making transformations to specific columns and not to the entire dataset. For instance, it's very common to standardize continuous features but not categorical features.  This will now become much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrading to version 0.20\n",
    "The first release candidate for version 0.20 was put out just a couple days ago. You can install it with either conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `conda install scikit-learn=0.20rc1 -c conda-forge/label/rc -c conda-forge`\n",
    "\n",
    "or pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `pip install - pre scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introducing `ColumnTransformer` and the upgraded `OneHotEncoder`\n",
    "With the upgrade to version 0.20, many workflows from Pandas to Scikit-Learn should start looking similar. The `ColumnTransformer` estimator applies a transformation to a specific subset of columns of your Pandas DataFrame (or array).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OneHotEncoder` estimator is not new but has been upgraded to encode string columns. Before, it only encoded columns containing numeric categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how these new additions work to handle string columns in a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kaggle Housing Dataset\n",
    "One of Kaggle's beginning machine learning competitions is the [Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques][2]. The goal is to predict housing prices given about 80 features. There are a mix of continuous and categorical columns. You can download the data from the website or use their [command line tool][3] (which is very nice).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspect the data\n",
    "Let's read in our DataFrame and output the first few rows."

When using a pipeline, we must use the name of the step followed by a double-underscore and then the parameter name. If there are multiple layers to your pipeline, as we have here, we must continue using double-underscores to move up a level until we reach the estimator whose parameters we would like to optimize."

    "# Building a custom transformer that does it all\n",
    "There are a few limitations to the above workflow. For instance, it would be nice if the `OneHotEncoder` gave you the option of ignoring missing values during the fit method. It could simply encode missing values as a row of all zeros. Currently, it forces us to fill the missing values with some string and then encodes this string as a separate column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low frequency strings\n",
    "Also, string columns that appear only a few times during the training set may not be reliable predictors in the test set. We may want to encode those as if they were missing as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing your own estimator class\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides some help within its documentation on writing your own estimator class. The `BaseEstimator` class found within the base module provides the `get_params` and `set_params` methods for you. The `set_params` method is necessary when doing a grid search. You can write your own or inherit from the `BaseEstimator`. There is also a `TransformerMixin` but it just writes the `fit_transform` method for you. We do this in one line of code below, so we don't inherit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following class BasicTransformer does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fills in missing values with either the mean or median for numeric columns\n",
    "* Standardizes all numeric columns\n",
    "* Uses one hot encoding for string columns\n",
    "* Does not fill in missing values for categorical columns. Instead it encodes them as a 0's\n",
    "* Ignores unique values in string columns in the test set\n",
    "* Allows you to choose a threshold for the number of occurrences a value must have in a string column. Strings below this threshold will be encoded as all 0's\n",
    "* It only works with DataFrames and is just experimental and not tested so it will break for some datasets\n",
    "* It is called 'basic' because, these are probably the most basic transformations that typically get done to many datasets."

    "This article introduced a new workflow that will be available to Scikit-Learn users who rely on Pandas for the initial data exploration and preparation. A much smoother and feature-rich process for taking a Pandas DataFrame and transforming it so that it is ready for machine learning is now done through the new and improved estimators `ColumnTransformer`, `SimpleImputer`, `OneHotEncoder`, and `KBinsDiscretizer`.\n",
