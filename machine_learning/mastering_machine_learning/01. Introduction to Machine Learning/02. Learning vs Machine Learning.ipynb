    "# Learning vs Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to machine learning, it's a good idea to distinguish between it and just learning by itself. Simply put, learning is the ability to **improve at a task**. Learning is done by animals, humans, and some machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a task?\n",
    "\n",
    "A task is a clearly defined piece of work. In our context, tasks will be objectively quantifiable. Tasks such as learning how to use a fork to put food into your mouth, reading English, doing multiplication, recognizing faces, or estimating the price of a house can all be objectively measured with some metric that quantifies how well it has been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring task performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning happens when the person or machine improves its performance at completing the task. This could be measured as the time it takes food to travel from a plate to the mouth via the fork, or the percentage of the time a face is correctly guessed given an image. All of the measurements of performance in machine learning are objectively quantifiable allowing us to make strict comparisons between different learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is often defined as the ability of a machine to learn (to improve on a specific task) without being explicitly programmed to do so. At first, the machine has no idea how to complete the task. It is given historical data and with this data constructs a model which is used to improve its performance on the task. We say that a model has been **trained** once it finishes learning from the data. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to complete similar tasks in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is \"explicitly programmed\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key qualifier from the definition of machine learning, is that no explicit programming must be done. It is possible to develop an intelligent system with explicit programming. For instance, with our housing dataset, a software engineer can sit down with a professional real-estate agent and encode very specific rules on how to determine the price of a house. An example of a rule might be, \"In neighborhood A, houses with 3,000 square feet, 3 bedrooms, and an above average basement are priced at 250k dollars\". There might be hundreds of explicit rules that need to be programmed to handle every single scenario. This would be an example of explicit programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model built by the software engineer using the real-estate's expertise would not be applicable to any other problem. The model is explicitly programmed for this one specific problem of determining house prices. Different rules would need to be created for each unique problem. The machine isn't learning in this instance, although it can make intelligent decisions thanks to the explicit programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of not explicit programming - Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression model is an example of an intelligent system that is not explicitly programmed. Instead of a human expert determining the importance of square footage, number of bedrooms, and any other data collected on houses, the model learns on its own how to weigh the importance of each variable. The model is built independent of any specific human expert\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isn't Linear Regression explicitly programmed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there obviously must be someone who writes the code to train a linear regression model, but this code never changes. It is written once and can be used for many different problem, not just for modeling the sale price of a house. The same code can be used to model stock prices, tree height, insurance claims, economic indicators, and an infinite number of other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "With explicit programming, any update to the model would have to be programmed by a human being and any new problem would have to be programmed with completely different humans by another human. With machine learning, the model is trained just by giving it the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The two types of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major types of machine learning, **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning. In supervised learning, each observation (each row of data) has a corresponding **label**. This label is considered the **ground truth** and is what we are interested in predicting in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression vs Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Within supervised learning, there are two possible types of labels which determine whether we have a **regression** or **classification** problem. Data with **continuous value** labels are called regression and those with **discrete categories** are called classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous values\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous values are always numeric and the distinct set of possibilities is usually uncountable. The sale price of a house, tree height, or the amount of revenue generated from a movie are examples of continuous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete categories\n",
    "\n",
    "The other group of labels are those that are discrete categories. The distinct set of these labels are usually limited and known. Detecting the type of language given some text, or the type of animal given an image are examples of discrete categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "With unsupervised learning, there is no label corresponding to each observation and therefore no ground truth. Instead of making predictions, we are usually interested in grouping (**clustering**) together similar observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine yourself going on a deep outer space voyage to a strange and distant world that nobody has ever seen before. When you get there, every object you lay your eyes upon will be foreign. There will be no label to describe anything that you see. But over time, your mind will automatically organize these new objects into similar categories. The human mind is excellent at finding patterns and grouping similar looking objects together. You might eventually use a label to describe similar objects. This sort of organizing that human brains do naturally is what a machine attempts to do during unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go further, let's clarify some terminology that will be used throughout the course. There is no standard universal terminology or notation for all of machine learning so these terms might be different than those you encounter in other texts.\n",

    "* **Input Data** - Both supervised and unsupervised learning have input data. This data is a two-dimensional array where each row represents a single observation. It is sometimes referred to as the **design matrix**. When programming in Python, we will use the variable name `X`.\n",
    "* **Feature** - A single column of the input data. It's also referred to as a **predictor** or **explanatory** variable.\n",
    "* **Observation** - A single row of input data. It's also referred to as a **sample** or **example**.\n",
    "* **Output Data** - The label (ground truth) of each observation that is only available during supervised learning. It's also called the **target** variable or the **label**. When programming in Python, we will use the variable name `y`.\n",
