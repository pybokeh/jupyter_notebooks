    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python's Origins\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. It takes its name from Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamic language but is strongly typed (i.e. variables are untyped but refer to objects of fixed type).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### How Python Evolves\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Python evolves in a fairly straightforward way, more-or-less like this:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - people propose changes by writing *Python Enhancement Proposals* ([PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/))\n",
    "> - the Python core committee will assign a 'dictator' who will decide whether the PEP is worthy of becoming part of the standard, and if so it does, after some amount of discussion and revision\n",
    "> - disagreements are finally settled by Guido van Rossum, Python's inventor and the 'Benevolent Dictator for Life' (BDFL). _In July 2018, after a heated set of discussions around [PEP 572](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/), Guido announced he was stepping down from the BDFL role, and that the Python core committee would need to come up with a new form of arbitration_\n",
    "> \n",
    "> An important standard PEP is the Style Guide, [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). By default, PyCharm will warn of any PEP-8 violations. There are external tools such as [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) that can be used to check code for compliance in other environments, or you can use a code formatter like [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black).

    "### StackOverflow is your friend!\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python questions and Python data science questions, make use of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python). Pay attention to comments on suggested answers; the \"accepted answer\" is often not the best. Look for comments about whether it is the \"most Pythonic\". Python has an idiomatic style different to many other languages and so a novice coming from another language will often accept an answer that is closer to idiomatic in that other language rather than Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you're struggling to understand some code in your early days with Python, you may find this '[execution visualizer](http://pythontutor.com/)' helpful, as well as this [infographic](https://pythonforbiologists.com/29-common-beginner-errors-on-one-page/) of common Python errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Batteries Included\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is often described as having \"batteries included\". This is a reference to the rich set of libraries (packages)included in the standard distribution as well as the vast collection of freely available packages that can be used to bootstrap your development. Or, as Randall Munroe puts it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many thousands of Python packages available, often giving you many choices for similar purposes. One way to find quality packages is to look the curated lists at https://python.libhunt.com/ and https://awesome-python.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 2.7 or Python 3.x?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use conda to create a Python 2.7 virtual environment for when you have to use 2.7, but all new projects should be Python 3.5 or later. Python 2.7 is the end of the 2.x line and will be end-of-lifed on Jan 1, 2020; pandas, the main Python package for data science work, will drop 2.7 support at the end of 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What IDE Should I Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many IDEs and editors have support for Python usually through plugins. If yours does, that's probably the best option. Examples are Atom, Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text. My personal go-to IDE is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from JetBrains; it's not lightweight but it is arguably the most powerful option. There is a free community edition and a commercial version. You may also find [this article](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-ide-for-python) comparing and recommending IDEs interesting, but strangely they never included PyCharm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're going to be doing data science, my recommendation is to use the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). It comes with most of the packages you will need already compiled and ready to use. If you don't need all of those extras you could install the [stripped-down \"Miniconda\" version](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). I suggest that you install for yourself only, which on Mac or Linux will put the installation in a subdirectory of your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Macs come with Python already installed. I still recommend installing Anaconda. You will need to add the Anaconda bin directory to your path before the system-installed Python path. For example, on my Mac this means adding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    export PATH=/Users/gram/anaconda/bin:$PATH\n",
    "    \n",
    "to my .zshrc file (I use zsh as my shell), as my home directory is /Users/gram. I've seen some recent installations use anaconda3 instead of anaconda as the directory name. If you install for all users then the directory would be relative to the root, not your home directory; i.e. /anaconda/bin or /anaconda3/bin. On Windows, Anaconda will add some commands to the start menu to allow you to launch a console with Python accessible, so you don't need to fiddle with paths. You can read more about installing [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to get Python from the source, then on a Mac or Windows you should download and install from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On Linux, follow the instructions [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python docs\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/ has very detailed documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python packages have good documentation at https://readthedocs.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Python a lot on a Mac you may find [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) useful; it is a utility that gives you fast access to context-sensitive help for many libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, Python has a help() function that is very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Hitchhiker's Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) is a very useful, extremely comprehensive opinionated guide."

    "## Using the REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the REPL (read-execute-print loop, or interactive interpreter), just type `python` at the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `help()` function to read the documentation for a module/class/function. As a standalone invocation, you enter the help system and can explore various topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python scripts are stored in plain text files with `.py` extensions. You can run the script `foo.py` at the command line by invoking:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python foo.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "When you do so the Python interpreter will compile the script to an intermediate bytecode, and the result will be stored in a file with the same base name and a `.pyc` extension. As an optimization, the interpreter will look to see if a `.pyc` file with a more recent file modification date exists when you invoke it to run a script and use that if it does. In Python 2.x these files were saved alongside the Python source files but in Python 3.x they are stored in a subdirectory named `__pycache__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### A better REPL: bpython\n",
    "> \n",
    "> [bpython](https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/) is an alternative REPL that adds a number of useful features at the command line, like syntax highlighting and auto-completion. \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> You can install with `pip install bpython`.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> If you're going to use the command line repl I recommend it, although there are other options too that I haven't tried:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - ptpython https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython\n",
    "> - DreamPie http://dreampie.sourceforge.net/\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Yet another alternative to the REPL, of course, is Jupyter.\n",

Conda has a smaller set of packages which is why it doesn't always succeed, but the ones it does have have been built for Conda so installing that way is preferred.\n",

We won't do that here, but it is worth knowing about, and it is a recommended best practice when starting a new application. You can also use this to create a Python 2 environment after installing Python 3, and vice-versa.\n",

The most useful functions here are related to getting the system time zone and the `time.sleep()` function which pauses execution;\n",

    "In addition to this, there are some good third-party libraries to be aware of, that, amongst other things, provide flexible date parsing operations from different formats. The most commonly used one, that extends the functionality of `datetime`, is `dateutil` (https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) but another that is growing in popularity is `arrow` (http://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which provides a completely different approach with a very natural API. \n",

If you want everything plus the kitchen sink and a very opinionated chef, you will love [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/); many big-name websites do. If you want something in-between, look at [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/), which would be my choice.

For something quick and dirty, TkIntr is the way to go, but if you want a native-looking polished cross-platform app, you should use one of the other two.\n",
