    "- what is the difference in Pronto usage by annual members and short-term users? How might Pronto evolve to be more useful to these groups?\n",
    "- how do Pronto trips compare to trips by other cyclists in the city? Can characteristics of Pronto use give us insight into deeper trends within the city?\n",

    "- Annual Members and Day Pass users show markedly different behavior in aggregate: annual members seem to use Pronto mostly for commuting from point A to point B on Monday-Friday, while short-term users use Pronto primarily on weekends to explore particular areas of town.\n",
    "- While annual members seem savvy to the pricing structure, one out of four short-term-pass rides exceeds the half hour limit and incurs an additional usage fee. For the sake of the customer, Pronto should probably make effort to better inform short-term users of this pricing structure.\n",
    "- Elevation and weather affect use just as you would expect: among annual members, there are nearly twice as many downhill trips as uphill trips, and cold & rain significantly decrease the number of rides on a given day. The effect of weather on Pronto ride numbers over the course of the year is comparable to that seen for riders crossing the Fremont Bridge.\n",
    "- Pronto's share of bicycle trips in the city has been relatively steady since day 1. This is interesting because we might expect the number of Pronto trips to have grown as the year went on, but it seems that adjusted for weather, the number of trips has been basically constant."

    "Looking at the trends among all five of these identified individuals, we see a couple commonalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Morning commute rides tend to be a few minutes faster than evening commute rides**. Perhaps people are tired at the end of the day, or perhaps they are more relaxed when they don't need to get to work at a certain time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In all these cases, rider speed increased gradually over time**. All of these riders show a trend of getting faster with time. For the more extreme riders, this improvement is as much as 10-15%, which indicates a fairly substantial improvement in health!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **These are probably new(ish) riders**. Riders who were already riding their own bike frequently before Pronto existed would not likely show such a significant improvment in fitness over time. So I think we can be fairly confident that these power-users are riding **more** frequently now with Pronto than they were before Pronto existed.\n",

    "We could certainly go further and find less significant clusters, and probably identify dozens or hundreds more individuals based on their ridership patterns.\n",
    "We could also cross-match nearby stations to determine whether anyone is using, say, a different station on the way to work versus on the way home.\n",
    "We could compute aggregate statistics on how Pronto is improving health, based on this probabilistically de-anonymized data.\n",
    "The possibilities really are endless, but I've written enough here already!"
