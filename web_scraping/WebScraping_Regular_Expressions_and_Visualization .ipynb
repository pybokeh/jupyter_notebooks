Here we will scrape the data from the web, parse the results using regular expressions, and visualize the data. This small project could probably be done a lot more efficiently by hand, but the ideas here are powerful and can be extended to much larger applications. There are many tools that a data scientist will need to use, and web scraping, regular expressions, and visualization are all good techniques to practice!
